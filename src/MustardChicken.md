# Mustard Chicken

This is a marinade for chicken that adds some good flavor. It is very simple in the fact that there are only two real items, and the rest is flavor to taste.

| Name                 | Amount  |
|----------------------|---------|
| Stone Ground Mustard | 1/2 cup |
| Red Wine Vinegar     | 1/4 cup |

I add in ground black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder; this amount works fine for 6 chicken breasts.
