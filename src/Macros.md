# Macros

When planning a nutrition plan, there are two things that seem to be important: how many calories needed, and how to spend them.

## IIFYM (If it fits your macros)

[IIFYM Calculator](https://www.iifym.com/iifym-calculator/) helps figure out how many calories are needed in a day. Its best to be honest when putting things into the site; for example, daily activity is SEDENTARY for most people (I am at a desk all day).

## Macros Nutrient Calculator

[Macro Nutrient Calculator](http://macronutrientcalculator.com/) will take the number given from IIFYM and let you calculate your macros given your plan. There are many different plans to follow and what works for you is the most important part.
