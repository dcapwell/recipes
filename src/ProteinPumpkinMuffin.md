# Protein Pumpkin Muffins

This recipe is a mixture of two different ones (listed below).

My muffin pan has 12 containers with 2.5oz in each, so the batch can't be more than 30oz (850g) total. For this reason, the recipe serves two.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

|----------------|----------------|---------|------|-----|
| Protein Powder | 2 scoops (61g) | 48g     | 4g   | 2g  |
| Egg Whites     | 230g           | 25g     | 0g   | 0g  |
| Pumpkin        | 246g           | 2g      | 20g  | 0g  |
